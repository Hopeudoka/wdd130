                My name is Hope Ini Udoka. I live in a little town called Eket in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. 
                I come from a family of 8 including my parents. I have a lot of hobbies, I love doing almost 
                anything interesting during my spare time. This may include:  playing video games, reading, spending time 
                with my family, and spending time outdoors. 
                I love learning about computers and how they work. I have always been attracted to technology. I 
                want to end up creating something cool, that will benefit humanity. To achieve this goal I have to 
                learn all I can about technology. I am pursuing a degree in software development from Brigham Young 
                University Idaho. Getting my degree will help me secure a good job, which will give me experience in 
                the world of technology, and help me start my own company. I have served as a full-time missionary for 
                The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Lagos, Nigeria Mission. Currently, I serve as the stake assistant clerk.
